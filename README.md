# testing_the_mic

A new Flutter project for reciording audio from Flutter.

## Code Summary
There was not enough time to complete this task. Usually tasks like these run in days and not 4 hours but I did what I could. 
The code on submission was incomplete:
The available functionality just lets you start and stop recording using a forground service in the and android side called by a channel on the flutter side

## Many of the requirements are not complete. 
1. There is no upload or transcribe functionality
2. The UI was barely modified (I prioritized functionality)

## Regrets
1. Used MediaRecorder instead of AudioRecorder and realized too late that MediaRecorder did not support WAV files
2. Not spending more time on the UI
